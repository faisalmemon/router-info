# Getting the Router IP Address

This is a iOS simple app to get the Router's IP address. 

The real code came from [Vallieres' Cordova Plug-in](https://github.com/vallieres/cordova-plugin-get-router-ip-address).
I've just wrapped up the essential code into a trivial app.
This app relates to [StackOverflow Question: "How to get Router IP address after getting the IP address of the iOS device"](https://stackoverflow.com/q/60579740/2715565)
